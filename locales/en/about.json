    "description": "is a community-based project for verifying content published on the Internet, launched by the Polish Press Agency (PAP) together with GovTech Polska. It aims to demystify and refute false information related to the SARS-CoV-2 virus.",
    "collapsed": {
      "1": "Every Internet user will be able to identify and report doubtful content for verification and then receive a reliable, fact-based answer, cross-checked by external opinion leaders and PAP experts, based on trusted, official sources.",
      "2": "The number of false publications on the Internet has been growing at a dangerous rate. Their aim is to spread disinformation and panic, injecting fear into people’s minds and add drama in that already dramatic period of the epidemic. The #FakeHunter project was born out of the need to counter such a situation; in a bid to encourage websites and all social media users to responsibly share only evidence-based messages.",
      "3": "Who are we?",
      "4": "The Polish Press Agency (PAP) is a state-owned enterprise (SOE) operating based on a bill dating back to 31 July 1997. Under this law, PAP is a public press agency that gathers and disseminates reliable, objective and comprehensive domestic and foreign information to its clients.",
      "5": "The GovTech Polska program is a Task Force operating at the Chancellery of the Prime Minister of Poland (Kancelaria Prezesa Rady Ministrów, KPRM), under the Prime Minister's direct supervision and patronage. The Team is responsible for horizontal, cross-ministerial strategic projects concerning innovation, new technologies, and digitization. It aims at creating the modern, citizen-friendly, fully digital and future-oriented State together with innovators and technology enthusiasts: businesses, start-ups, the scientific community and the citizens themselves.",
      "6": "Sources of funding",
      "7": "The basic sources of funding for the Polish Press Agency are revenues from fees for its information services delivered to clients, as well as incomes from economic activities not contradictory to and without any conflict of interest with the goals outlined in the law. The sources of funding also include special-purpose subsidies from the state budget related to the fulfillment of the goals outlined in the law and which constitute about 15 percent of the PAP's annual revenue."
