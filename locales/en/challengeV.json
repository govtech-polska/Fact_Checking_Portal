    "description": "In cyberspace, false information, popularly known as fakes, is appearing more and more often on a scale larger than you think. They pertain to many areas of life, consciously or without being misleading. Anyone can be a victim of disinformation or even fraud. Without realizing what fake news is and how powerful it is, we believe what we read and watch too easily. The time of the coronavirus pandemic has shown the importance of the fight against false information. People started to believe that 5G technology causes Covid-19 disease and cancer, vaccines cause autism, and wearing face masks can be dangerous to your health. The victims of information scams on the Internet are, among others, ordinary people, public figures, companies whose market value is destroyed due to fake news.",
